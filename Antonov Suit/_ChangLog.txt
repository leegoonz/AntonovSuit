v0.052

Added "Remove Prove" to the sky tool

Changed sky editor code to add numbers in the name

v0.051

Added dual lightmaps support, use #define DUALLIGHTMAP_ON to enable it, see _ReadMe
Added sky tool, it is no more needed to feed shaders with LUT textures manually, spawn a probe from it and you can set ambient light with it and apply general diffuse and specular cubemap
Added metallic option to the SSR

Fixed single, directionnal lightmap issues
Fixed in error in G-Buffer for SSR

Changed probe script code
Changed SSR ray march code
Changed SSR roughness behavior
Changed diffuse convolution to be more powerfull (I may revert to the old one)

Removed occlusion from direct diffuse lighting

v0.050

Fixed wrong shader parameter name
Fixed illum shader

v0.045, 046, 047, 048, 049

Added documentations
Added Quixel Suit profile
Added SSR

Fixed Cutoff not working in DX11
Fixed casting shadows with self-illum shaders
Fixed SSR for DX9
Fixed Skin point/spot light red gradient

Changed convolution code
Changed Lod calculation for convolution

Moved Alpha to _MainTex see _Readme for infos

v0.044

Fixed errors with build

v0.043

Added exposure control for diffuse and specular cubemap ( request )
Added preview sphere for cubemap
Added edge scale bleeding for smoothedge ( DX9 )
Added three type of convolution for diffuse cubemap
Added view dependent roughness ( see GDC FOX Engine )
Added edge fix for dx9 in shader ( as a test )

Fixed black edge in the lookup texture generator
Fixed G_smith model in the lookup texture generator 

Changed samples amount for a quality setting for convolution
Changed cubemap size for a fixed size choice
Changed exponent math for GGX cubemap to match more the importance sampling reference
Changed skybox convolution projection
Changed smooth edge to wokr only on DX9 as DX11 use its own edge fix
Changed fresnel for cubemap with lookup texture ( D_GGX and G_Smith used as default now )

Removed #pragma_multi_compil for convolution type and moved to different shader instead

Improved convolution speed ( a bit )

v0.042

Added specular workflow
Added toksvig factor parameter in shader

Changed sphere projection code ( Nvidia approach )
Changed material path for specular and mettalic workflow.

Fixed occlusion on direct specular

Removed skin atten shadows from point and spot light in the Pre Integrated Skin

v0.041

Added sqrt(roughness); roughness* roughness; which gives better reponse in low range. The Order 1886

Added Rea skybox shader
Added logo to the probe tool
Added "Bake With IBL" to allow IBL capture

Refactored probe tool GUI

Fixed DX11 flip upside down capture
Fixed Z Up vetor in the importance sampling shader
Fixed mip map lod math


Changed "Reflection" and "Irradiance" shader name to "Hidden/Antonov Suit/Radiance" and to "Hidden/Antonov Suit/Irradiance"


v0.04

Added box and sphere projection
Added attenuation control for box and sphere projection ( experimental )
Added burley diffuse model ( use ANTONOV_DIFFUSE_BURLEY instead of ANTONOV_DIFFUSE_LAMBERT )

Changed fresnel for Skin PreIntegrated shader

Removed fresnel lut for a math fresnel ( as a test )

Fixed serialized enum being reset when changing values in the probe tool

v0.036

Fixed "unexpected token '&&'"

v0.035

Refactored some lines of code

Changed exponent calculation for convolution
Changed lightmap attenuation for cubemap to match dielectric and metallic behavior

Fixed sharp transition in the cubemap mip map
Fixed problem with point and spot light attenuation
Fixed a division by PI in the skin diffuse color


v0.03

Added GPU based convolution for cubemap using importance sampling
Added GGX and Blinn-Phong specular model in the probe tool
Added toksvigAA ( as a TEST )

v0.02

Added single and directionnal lightmap
Added importance sample amount control to probe tool

Changed RGBM encoding for unity free

Fixed issue with uint
Fixed issue with build : "Assets/Antonov Suit/Scripts/AntonovSuitProbe.cs(151,17): error CS0103: The name `EditorApplication' does not exist in the current context"
Fixed _Illum error while making lightmap with beast
