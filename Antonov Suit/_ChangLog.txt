v0.044

fixed errors with build

v0.043

added exposure control for diffuse and specular cubemap ( request )
added preview sphere for cubemap
added edge scale bleeding for smoothedge ( DX9 )
added three type of convolution for diffuse cubemap
added view dependent roughness ( see GDC FOX Engine )
added edge fix for dx9 in shader ( as a test )

fixed black edge in the lookup texture generator
fixed G_smith model in the lookup texture generator 

changed samples amount for a quality setting for convolution
changed cubemap size for a fixed size choice
changed exponent math for GGX cubemap to match more the importance sampling reference
changed skybox convolution projection
changed smooth edge to wokr only on DX9 as DX11 use its own edge fix

removed #pragma_multi_compil for convolution type and moved to different shader instead

improved convolution speed ( a bit )

v0.042

changed material path for specular and mettalic workflow.

fixed occlusion on direct specular

removed skin atten shadows from point and spot light in the Pre Integrated Skin
